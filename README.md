Contact Discord: `megastruktur#5704` in case you find any bugs or if you have any suggestions.

## Usage

`"Item" - all classes, crew types, upgrades, items, abilities, upgrades, etc.`

- To reset reputation, exp, etc counters just click on the label name.
- Health clock can be reset by clicking on "Healing" table header.
- To add items you can click a corresponding link or drag items from compendium/game to the sheet.
- All "class/crew" specific items are prefixed with first letters

- I don't want the "class/crew items" to be prepopulated, so the character sheet contains less "compendium" info.
- To see the description of Class, Vice, Background, etc you can just click added item and see all the info in the popup.
- When adding a new item you can hower a "question-circle" icon to see the item's description.
- To add Custom abilities just add a new "Foundry Item" of the corresponding type and fill all the necessary info. Then drag it to the sheet or add via button on a sheet.

Classes:

- (C) Cutter
- (H) Hound
- (Le) Leech
- (Lu) Lurk
- (Sl) Slide

- (W) Whisper

Crew Types:

- (A) Assassins

## To be done in the nearest future

- Clocks
- Friends/rivals section
- Stress/Harm dynamic values (can be modified by abilities but for now are hardcoded)
- Enhance Dice Rolling (ability modifiers)

## Troubleshooting

- If you can't find the drag-n-dropped item, refer to "All Items" tab on each sheet.
